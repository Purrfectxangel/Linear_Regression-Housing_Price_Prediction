This is homework project I completed for course CS559 Machine learning Fundamentals and Applications at Stevens Institute of Technology. In this project, I trained a dataset to predict house price of unit area.
There are 2 files in this repository:
1. The Jupyter Notebook that contains all the codes, comments as well as data analytics and training process of the model.
2. The dataset used in the project (Real estate.csv). This dataset is provided in the course and not from any public sources that I know of.
